参见Create a checklist note called _NewCheckList_.yaml：记录了完整的动作过程，两次点击ok没有发生状态转换（有弹提示词后消失），在输入“NewCheckList”后又输入了一次“NewCheckList”没有发生状态转换；缺少步骤：一是点击输入软键盘的ok按钮收回软键盘，再然后点击OK按钮完成任务。所以只是部分完成，且中间存在无效操作的情况。

taskname.yaml:记录完整的任务过程
states:记录状态，包含截图和ActivityViewHierarchy。去除了重复状态
states_view_ids:记录状态对应的id（文件名），内含精简后的h5元素。去除了重复状态
views:动作事件对应的view的截图。去除了重复截图，小于等于全部事件，但是仍比状态转换中的事件可能要多
utg.js:包含app\device\task的meta信息，以及状态转换过程（包括状态和事件）。注意同一个界面（类似Activity）上因为元素值的不同，可能对应不同的状态，他们的structure_str为同一个，但是state_str不同。utg.js中structure_str等同于state.json中的state_str_content_free属性。

You are a smartphone assistant to help users complete tasks by interacting with mobile apps.Given a task, the previous UI actions, and the content of current UI state, your job is to decide whether the task is already finished by the previous actions, and if not, decide which UI element in current UI state should be interacted.
Task: Create a checklist note called 'NewCheckList'
Previous UI actions: 
- launchApp Notes
Current UI state:

Your answer should always use the following format: { "Steps": "...<steps usually involved to complete the above task on a smartphone>", "Analyses": "...<Analyses of the relations between the task, and relations between the previous UI actions and current UI state>", "Finished": "Yes/No", "Next step": "None or a <high level description of the next step>", "id": "an integer or -1 (if the task has been completed by previous UI actions)", "action": "tap or input", "input_text": "N/A or ...<input text>" } 

**Note that the id is the id number of the UI element to interact with. If you think the task has been completed by previous UI actions, the id should be -1. If 'Finished' is 'Yes', then the 'description' of 'Next step' is 'None', otherwise it is a high level description of the next step. If the 'action' is 'tap', the 'input_text' is N/A, otherwise it is the '<input text>'. Please do not output any content other than the JSON format. **
